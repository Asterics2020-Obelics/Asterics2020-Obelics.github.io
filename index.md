# OBELICS work package

OBELICS (OBservatory E-environments LInked by common ChallengeS) is enabling interoperability and software re-use for the data generation, integration and analysis of the ASTERICS ESFRI and pathfinder facilities. OBELICS is creating an open innovation environment for establishing open standards and software libraries for multi-wavelength/multi-messenger data. OBELICS is also developing common solutions for streaming data processing and extremely large databases, as well as studying advanced analysis algorithms and software frameworks for data processing and quality control.

OBELICS is divided into 4 tasks:
- MAUD
- D-GEX
- D-INT
- D-ANA

This github repository groups all OBELICS developments and events.
